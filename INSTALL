VCP Installation Instructions

Before installing VCP, you must install the XML Parsing library "Expat",
available at:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

Installing that allows XML::Parser to install, which allows
XML::ValidWriter to install, which allows VCP to install.

You will also need a p4d >= 99.2 if you want to use the p4 I/O features,
since vcp uses the filelog -m option.

VCP is all Perl code, and uses a number of other Perl modules.  Installing
these is a bit of a pain, but CPAN will do it for you automatically.  To
install VCP using CPAN, do

   $ perl -MCPAN -eshell
   cpan> install VCP

If you have all of the required modules installed and you don't want to run CPAN
for some reason, you can do the standard Perl module install sequence:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make 
   $ make test
   $ make install

If you don't have all the required modules installed, the "perl Makefile.PL"
step will tell you what's missing.  If it doesn't complain about something
that laterturns up missing, it's a bug, please report it.

If you want to install the required modules without installing VCP, do:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> make VCP

Now you can work with a VCP development tree without having to manually install
lots of modules manually.

You could install the older version of VCP and work with the newer one, but
then perl won't warn you if you forgot to set PERL5LIB correctly and you'll be
working with mismatched libraries, some from the source tree and some older
versions from the perl/site_lib/ tree.
